Allowing unrestricted non commercial usage and limiting commercial usage only to cases where the end user would be cannibalizing the original author's revenue opportunities.
Granting users the right to self-host or use a third party hosting option as their provider, so long as the original not work is not being dealt as a SaaS or otherwise being sold in a manner that would violate the excluded commercial activities.
Provide a starting mechanism for users who wish to deal the original software to come to an agreement with the original author, either via commercial licensing or a FOSS license request.
Encourage Collaboration and Community Development by:
